hello I am professor de panache of theDepartment of Physics at IIT Bombay I amgoing to be giving 20 our lectures on asubject which is an evolving subjectknown as quantum information andcomputing let me take a bit of a time inexplaining to you what is this subjectabout it is an emerging subject in manyIITs and icers and many students of bothengineering and physics take it as anelective at the moment the courserequires familiarity with subjects suchas linear algebra and operators andmatrices basically you need somefamiliarity with these subjects and anexposure to the principles of quantummechanics this exposure does not meanthat you should have been familiar withsolutions of Schrodinger equation but itrequires more a familiarity and thelevel of philosophy of quantum mechanicswhich is normally given to all studentsof science and engineering in first andsecond year of the university orengineering colleges so let me begin bytelling you what is this subject and whoare going to be benefiting from itfirstly let us look at what is classicalcomputing all about if you know acomputer has basically two componentsone is known as a hardware that is thebasic electronics and circuitry on whichthe computation actually proceeds andthe second one is the software or thealgorithms and programs based on whichpeople provide logic to such a systemnow what has been found is that in themodern electronics which depends uponintegrated circuit there is a law whichhas been governinghow speed has been increasing very fastthis law is known as the Moore's lawwhich essentially says the population ofthe transistors in an integrated circuithas been essentially doubling every 18months or two years now at that rate thesizes of these electronic componentsbecome smaller and smaller and theirspacings between them naturally becomesmuch smaller however there is a limit towhich you can make them small theultimate limit is when they reach atomicdimensions of course even transistorsand diodes and things like that as youknow they work on the principles ofquantum mechanics but however theclassical computing has always beenbased on classical logic by that I meanthe following supposing you take an NANDgate now according to the classicaldigital logic if the input of the NANDgate is 1 and 1 then the result has tobe 0 now this is where the quantummechanics differs from the classicalthing now in a quantum computer theinput and naturally the output can existin a simultaneous superposition of manystates and this provides an inherentparallelism to such computationprocesses now this results in a veryinteresting aspect that is known as aquantum entanglement the entanglement ofstates is not being able to write aquantum state as product of two statesis something which is very peculiar toquantum mechanics this both parallelismand entanglement it provides a tool fordoing computation with speeding up whichhas never been thought possible beforeand for instance development of quantumcomputing is still in a nascent Stateand only the laboratory prototypes areavailable but as we are aware thetechnology leaps so when the futuristicquantum computers come and arrivecommercially we must be prepared for itso there are two specific large-scalealgorithm that I would like to mentionone is a database search a database of nitems typically requires in classicalcomputing of the order of n searchesthere is an algorithm known as Grover'ssearch algorithm now this searchalgorithm speeds up this quadraticallynamely instead of the order of searchesbeing n it becomes square root of M thatis a substantial speeding up but themore interesting one is the way one canfactorize a large composite number whichis known to be product of two primenumbers as we know that in classicalcomputing this is a non polynomial timealgorithm now there is an algorithm dueto sure which has made it possible tofactorize such large numbers inpolynomial time now that has tremendousapplication in future communicationprotocols because today's algorithmswhich govern for example eventransactions that we do with banks andall that are based on what is known asthe RSA algorithm which is based on theprinciple while it is very easy to findproduct of two numbers it is notpossible to find the factors of largecomposite numbers in polynomial timehowever source algorithm has been shownto be possible to do so in a polynomialtime having done that we will introducewhat are known as the elements ofquantum cryptographic protocol that issecret communication securedcommunication for sending informationfrom one end to another this course willstart with components of eightcomputer go through the essential linearalgebra and we'll also introducepostulates of quantum mechanics whichare necessary enabling quantumcomputation and finally we'll prepareourselves for writing down there will beactually no programming techniques donehere but the algorithms for some of themajor problems that can be handled withquantum computation will be done withthat in mind I believe the people whocan benefit from such a course would beprimarily the Faculty of physicsElectrical Engineering and the course isnowadays being given in IITs and icersas elective courses which are beingtaken by students of physics andmathematics as by many engineeringdisciplines such as electricalengineering computer science etcetera soI hope you will be able to enjoy thiscourse which is essentially a futuristiccourse with the principles of quantummechanics and computer science weddedtogether thank youyou
